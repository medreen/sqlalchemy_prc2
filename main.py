# rules of a ReST API
# 1. Data is transferred as key value-pairs called JSON.Sending from JS as JSON Object and from python as dictionary
# 2. You must define routes/URL 
# 3. You must define a HTTP method(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH)
# 4. You must define a status code(200,201,404,401,500)
# 200 → success,201 → created,400 → bad request,401 → unauthorized,404 — Not Found,409 → conflict (email exists),500 → server error
